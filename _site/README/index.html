<h1>Funding Public Safety</h1>
<p>Helping Oaklanders understand the real impacts of public safety funding.</p>
<p>Funding Public Safety is a project of <a href="https://openoakland.org">OpenOakland</a>. OpenOakland is a volunteer collective that bridges community and technology for a thriving and equitable Oakland. We're a brigade of the nonprofit Code for America.</p>
<h3>Project context</h3>
<p>The City of Oakland allocates about $24 million each year to the Dept. of Violence Prevention, Oakland Police Dept. and the Oakland Fire Dept. to fund public safety and violence prevention programs. This pool of money is overseen by an oversight commission (the SSOC), a volunteer group of city residents appointed by the City. OpenOakland’s Funding Public Safety project is aimed at supporting the SSOC’s oversight efforts by making the City’s Measure Z evaluation reports more meaningful so the SSOC, impacted communities, and the general public can better understand how the money is being spent and how effective these programs are. We’re looking for folks to assess the community impacts of this project, analyze program data, and develop a dataviz strategy.</p>

<ol>
<li>Step-by-step instructions help new contributors get a development environment up and running quickly.</li>
<li>You'll want to find the balance between being specific enough for novices to follow, without being so specific that you reinvent the wheel by providing overly-basic instructions that can be found elsewhere.</li>
<li>Feel free to adapt this section and its sub-sections to your own processes.</li>
